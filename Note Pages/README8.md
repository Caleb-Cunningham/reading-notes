# JavaScript Notes
<p>
 JavaScript will be your bread and butter of web development and software development as a whole. These notes are for me to go over some basic things that can be done with this language.</p>

 ### Notes

 * With the _prompt_ command you can ask the user to do specific things like register their age or ask for their name.<br>
 * You can also use _If then_ statements basically what these do is cause a reaction to happen based off of user input. You can also pair this with other commands such as the _prompt_ command.<br>
 * There's also another important command these are _variables_ you get them by using the _var_ command they act as a placeholder in which you can set values to say for instance I wanted to store 2 inside of x the command would first be a declaration like this: _var x;_ then I would assign a value by doing this: _x = 2_ and there you have it!<br>

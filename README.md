# Markdown notes


### You can use markdown for web design 
* You can do things like *change the font of words*.
* Or you can make your words really stick out by making them **BOLD**.
* You can also ~slash out words~ to cover any uneeded text.
* There's also list you can create just like the one that i'm typing on now both ordered and unordered.
* That about wraps up my notes on markdown!

# Operators and Loops

_Operators & Loops_ are a crucial part to JavaScript. I will go over the different types of loops and talk more on operators.

### Notes

* _For loops_ are loops that continue until a specified condition evaluates to false.<br>
* _While Loops_  are the same as _for loops_ the only difference is that it keeps going until it evaluates to true.<br>
* _Assignment operators_ assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.<br>

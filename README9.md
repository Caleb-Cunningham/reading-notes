This  Is a deeper look into JavaScript these notes will show you more of what JavaScript has to offer.

### Notes

* Arithmetic Operators include _*,+*/,-,%_ these Operators will take in values and or more formally known as (operands)
* Comparison operators include _>,<,>=,<=,==,===,!=,!==_ JavaScript has a type conversion occuring where there are two properties of a value, the value itself, and the type of value.
* A value can be a number, a string _hello world_, _a_ _3425354a_, Boolean _true or false_
* More about strings: you can multiple things in strings things like variables and alerts, or else if stements, and many other things be sure to expirement with it.
